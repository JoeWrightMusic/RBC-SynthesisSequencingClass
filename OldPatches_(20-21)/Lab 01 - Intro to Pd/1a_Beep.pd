#X text 206 123 We can construct audio programs with objects in Pd
\, which mostly appear in boxes like this. The thick black tabs at
the top and bottom show us where we can connect inputs and outputs
for each object.;

#X text 140 207 We can click and drag from an output (a tab at the
bottom of an object) to an input (a tab on the top of an object) to
create a connection \, which we can think of as a patch cable.;
#X text 226 340 Some elements can be interacted with \, like this toggle
box. In this case \, it's used to turn the beep on/off;
#X text 8 51 This is a very simple starter patch: it allows us to turn
a pure tone on and off. For now \, lets just look at how the patch
is constructed...;

#X text 23 541 There are two modes in this canvas view: an 'Edit Mode'
and a 'Run Mode'. Switch between them with cmd-E \, and you will see
the cursor change.;
#X text 23 597 In edit mode \, the cursor will look like a hand. This
is the mode that lets you create and edit objects in your patch;
#X text 23 640 In run mode \, the patch is locked (you can't edit it)
\, and your cursor will change to an ordinary pointer. This lets you
interact with GUI (Graphical User Interface) objects more easily.;

# Synthesis & Sequencing Module
## Pd Lab Patches
### Joe Wright  - 2023

These patches are a collection of supporting materials for the Pure Data lab sessions as part of the Synthesis & Sequencing module at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.

To get started, simply download the repository and make sure that the 'Abstractions' folder is in Pd's filepath.

These patches are free to use with modification, but if you find yourself using them (especially for teaching), i'd love it if you'd let me know what you manage to get out of them!

# Synthesis & Sequencing Module
## Pd Lab Patches

## Joe Wright  - 2020/21
#### Labs 0-8 Developed from patches previously created for the module by James Dooley and Matthew D Evans


These patches are a collection of supporting materials for the Pure Data lab sessions as part of the Synthesis & Sequencing module at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. 

Two versions of these patches are included in the repo, one with Pd's default colour scheme, and one that uses canvas objects to create a pale coloured background. This background colour can be changed by clicking the canvas in the top left of each patch, and selecting a colour from the popup menu.

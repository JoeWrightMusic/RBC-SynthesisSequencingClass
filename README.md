# Synthesis & Sequencing Module
## Pd Lab Patches
### Joe Wright  - 2022

These patches are a collection of supporting materials for the Pure Data lab sessions as part of the Synthesis & Sequencing module at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. As of January 2022, these patches have been made for use with Purr Data, but should still be backwards compatible with Vanilla Pure Data as well.

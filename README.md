# Sequencing & Synthesis Module
## Pd Lab Patches
### Joe Wright  - 2024

These patches are a collection of supporting materials for the Pure Data lab sessions as part of the Sequencing & Synetheis module at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.

The patches are organised into weekly lab sessions, and are intended for use with PlugData:
[https://plugdata.org/](https://plugdata.org/)
The course content almost exclusively uses Pd Vanilla objects, and should work on other versions of Pd as well, barring a couple of PlugData specific examples. 

To get started, simply download the repository and make sure that the 'Abstractions' folder is in Pd's filepath.

These patches are free to use with modification, but if you find yourself using them (especially for teaching), i'd love it if you'd let me know what you manage to get out of them!

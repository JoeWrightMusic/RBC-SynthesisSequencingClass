#X text 251 313 Some elements can be interacted with \, like this toggle box. In this case \, it's used to turn the beep on/off, f 50;
#X text 8 51 This is a very simple starter patch: it allows us to turn a pure tone on and off. For now \, lets just look at how the patch is constructed..., f 87;

#X text 231 96 As shown in the 1.1 patch \, we can construct audio programs with objects in Pd \, which mostly appear in boxes like this. We've seen how the tabs at the top and bottom show us where we can connect inputs and outputs for each object., f 53;
#X text 165 187 Recall: we can click and drag from an output (a tab at the bottom of an object) to an input (a tab on the top of an object) to create a connection \, which we can think of as a patch cable., f 62;
#X text 215 252 Multiplying a signal like this changes its amplitude. In this case \, we reduce the volume by a factor of 10;
#X text 213 368 Multiplying again changes the volume here \, but this time we use the 0/1 output of the toggle to either nullify the amplitude (turn the signal off) or let it pass unchanged., f 56;
#X text 8 505 No sound? We need to turn on the audio engine to synthesise sound in Pd. In PlugData this is on by default when the software opens \, but in other versions of Pd this will be off. To check \, look in the bottom right of the window - the 'power-on' icon (next to the 'Limit' button) should be blue if audio is on \, and it'll be grey if it's off. You should also see a level meter for any audio coming out of Pd in that same corner of the screen., f 86;
